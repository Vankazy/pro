                    <p class="u1">I came into Tech Studio Academy with practically no prior knowledge in software development. However, within a few weeks, I was able to grasp the crux of software development and also master the soft skills required for being a software developer.

                    So far so good, the skills acquired have given me a mind-blowing push in my career as a software developer.

I had an immense learning that was really different from the self learning I started with. The learning was fun and there were some internship job opportunities that were presented to us. I got my first gig immediately after the program.
